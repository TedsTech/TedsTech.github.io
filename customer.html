  <p class="text-center"><em>How to take care of customer</em></p>
  <p>Customer service is the assistance and advice provided by a company to those people who buy or use its products or services. Customer service is very important to an organization because often it is the only panel for customers to contact and know about the company or organization. Your way of proving service represents your company. Personally I believe there are many things you can do to provide great customer service but there are also many things that you could possibly do to push your customers away.</p>
  <p>In my 5 years of experience in customer service I did few things also avoided many that helped me to deliver excellent customer service to my customers. Few things I did to provide good customer service are Giving my customers priority, Treat them nicely and with respect, Be honest, Take Responsibility, Made them feel like you value them and their opinions, Be professional, Always follow through Be more than a voice on the phone, Express your gratitude, Be patient, Try to be understanding on their problems, Have in-depth knowledge about the companyâ€™s products and services.</p>
  <p>Things that I had to avoid to deliver excellent customer service were letting things get unprofessional, refusing to help them, trying to win an argument with a customer, being inaccessible, making them wait a long time for someone's assistance, assuming that an online customer experience will replace offline service, treating customers as transactions, leaving your customer wondering, not following through, being unfamiliar with the Product, losing patience.
